THIS ENTIRE FOLDER IS AN EXPERIMENT, IGNORE IT


I'm making each individual instruction a class. This way, all can be stored in an array with 57 elements, one for each instruction. This makes executing the instruction you need.
I made templates each instruction should follow, under instructionStructure. Each instruction will inherit one of these.
